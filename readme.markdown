###game concept

a person is standing in a room, facing a wall of bricks. if they pull out one brick, others might fall. each brick has a word on it. behind the person is a mirror. if the person throws a brick at the mirror it will break and the reflection of the bricks will change. when the wall falls down, the person can walk through and needs to use the letters in the bricks they brought with them to play a word game (spelling numbers with the letters of the words they have to do math equations) with a standing outside next a river. when you beat the word game, maybe the reflection/real standing disappears? or a bridge appears wherever you arent?

room
  - this is where the person starts and looks at the wall of bricks. the person can turn around and look at the reflection of the bricks. they need to take the bricks out one by one, jenga style. they can throw a brick at the mirror behind them to see how the letters scramble in the cracked reflection. 

doorway
  - when the person has pulled out enough bricks, the wall falls down and the person can see a standing by a river. they can step outside (can they choose to step through the mirror, cracked or whole?)

outside
  - regular
    - when the person is outside, they talk to the standing. the standing gives them a word game that the person can play with the letters in the bricks they have. 

  - backwards
    - when the person walks into the reflection of outside, they talk to the standing, but everything they say is backwards. they play a backwards word game.
